# Shakespeare_project

The goal of this project is to create a way for directors of Shakepseare plays to have a manageable set of breakdowns.  

1) read in a GNU-licensed version of a given Shakespeare play from either the MIT Shakespeare site or my personal website: http://www.jasonkendall.com/shakespeare
2) remove all spoken words, leaving just the indications of the speeches by each character in each act and scene.
3) count of the speeches of each character in each scene.
4) create both HTML and CSV files as output.
